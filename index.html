												<h3>Will I have to hook up to the proposed sewer?</h3>
												<p>No, you will not have to hook up to the town's sewer, but there could be a penalty if you don't.<p> <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/indiana-code/title-36-local-government/article-9-transportation-and-public-works/chapter-23-municipal-sewage-works/section-36-9-23-30-municipal-power-to-require-connections-to-sewer-and-discontinuance-of-privies-cesspools-septic-tanks-and-similar-structures-conditions-penalties-court-order-attorneys-fees">Indiana Code</a> outlines the process.  After speaking with Curtis Ward regarding the numbers/map and how those of us on the fringe of the annexation area are affected. When the sewer is run, we don't have to hook on, However, if your property line is within 300 feet of the sewer line and we don't hook on, we could have to pay the town a fee or penalty for not tapping onto the line provided. Also, because police and fire protection will be provided for our neighbors on the other side of the road, it is common sense that officials would serve everybody excluded from the annexation because of the close proximity. Because of this, we would be required to pay for those services as well because they would be provided. By the time the ammenities are installed and made available to the area (and those outside of the annexation area by default), it may be just as cost effective to ask to be annexed (not including the property tax increase).</p>

												<h3>How will I know what my taxes will be?</h3>
												<p> The state of Indiana has a <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/10/tax-increment-financing-explained-tif-economic-development/597313/" target ="_blank">TIF Explaination</a>The county tax rate for Franklin County is total Tax Rate 1.4679% Your new tax rate when annexed will be Total Tax Rate 2.447%
												Example: If your home has an Assessed value of $181,000 and you have a Homestead and Mortgage Exemption, then your taxes will go from $1,254 to $2,090. This is an increase of $836 per year, along with every year that youâ€™re alive or choose to live in your home. That is only if there are no more taxes imposed on the poor, on behalf of the wealthy. Or, what if the 5 people on the town board choose to
												create a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district? Something that they use quite often in town when funds need to be collected to put towards something for the town. What happens when the golf course needs a new club house that hypothetical may not be covered by insurance (TBD) and the 5 board members ask for a bond or take money from fire and police to rebuild that clubhouse?

												<h3>What services can we expect and by when?</h3>
												<p>Services are still negotiable with the Brookville Town Council. Some of the proposed services are town sewer, town roads, and town police and fire protection. Nothing has been decided for sure, but the main service in question is a new sewer. <p>Indiana code: 36-4-3-13d(4) Non-capital Services - Soft Services (4) That planned services of a noncapital nature, including police protection, fire protection, and other non capital services normally provided within the corporate boundaries, will be provided to the annexed territory within one (1) year after the effective date of annexation and that they will be provided in a manner equivalent in standard and scope to those noncapital services provided to areas within the corporate boundaries regardless of similar topography, patterns of land use, and population density.  Indiana Code:36-4-3-13d(5) Capital Improvement (5) That services of a capital improvement, including nature, including street construction, street lighting, sewer facilities, water facilities, and stormwater drainage facilities, will be provided to the annexed territory within three(3) years after the effective date of the annexation in the same manner as those services are provided within the corporate boundaries, regardless of similar topography, patterns of land use, and population densidt, and in a manner constant with federal, state, and local laws, procedures and planning data.</p>

												<h3>Am I in the annexation area? Can the map change?</h3>
												<p>The map presented by the Brook Hill Preservation LLC, is outlined here. Any area shaded in yellow is in the proposed annexation area. This is the latest map. Remember, it will affect us all. And yes, the map can change depending on who withdraws their petition, decides to join the annexation area, or who is withdrawn by the town because their inclusion is not feasible. Per Curtis Ward as quoted from Whitewater Publications dated January 14, 2020, "The map would ultimately shrink, and that was the expectation". The final map will be defined by the final count of people petitioning for annexation. According to Ward, while the LLC won't be able to draw the map 100%, they will be able to give the town a general outline utilizing the county's GIS system. "It [the map] won't be complete because people have the ability to pull their peitition all the way up until a few weeks before adoption of the annexation ordinance." said Ward, "then it's final". Please follow the Brookville Town Board meetings on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month for additional information.  These meetings are video taped for your viewing and can be found on Know The Facts Brookville Facebook.</p>

												<h3>What are Common Sense Ordinances? Will I be Grandfathered In?</h3>
												<p>According to Curtis Ward, they will work with the DNR to create safe regulations for use of firearms in the proposed annexed area. Ward also said from his understanding, decisions such as these that are included in the fiscal plan bind the council as a whole regardless of what happens with future elections.</p>  <p>Common Sense ordinance also includes farm animals, fire pits (open burns) and quad riding on personal property. It may include other issues as noted in the Fiscal Plan. However, it should be noted if someone were to bring forth a valid argumet to the BTC, or if the population becomes more dense, then any one of those ordinances could be reversed in the best interest of the neighborhood and its residents.  If the ordinances are included in the fiscal plan, they will not be taken away unless there is a danger to the neighborhood or its residents.</p>

												<h3>Can the Annexation Still be stopped?  How Close is the Vote?</h3>
												<p>Absolutely it can be stopped. According to Gina Gillman, Town Clerk/Treasurer, she spoke to Bose, McKinney and Evans (BTC Annexation Attorneys), anyone who voted yes in favor of the annexation can ask their petition be pulled by "providing written notice of the withdraw of their signature." A copy of the signed petition along with the notice of withdrawal will be kept together.  As a property owner, if you chose to pull your vote, please keep a copy of your letter should it be needed for verification later.</p><p>  The recission paper turned inthe Gina MUST BE THE ORIGINAL. Keep a COPY for your records. The preliminary vote includes 254 Parcels. 132 petitions were in favor of annexation, 46 were opposed and 29 of the opposed were included in the proposed area while 17 were not included were on the border.
