                  <p><strong>**Disclaimer** This letter was written by the group against annexation, for the group against annexation and the group takes responsibility for the letter, whether written by any one individual or not. When we checked with the post office about a return address, renting a PO Box, or not having an address at all, they advised that we didn't need a return address so why rent a box just to have one?  Made sense to us, plus those for the annexation used a PO Box and when asked who mailed their post cards, their response was: "You know who did it." So, when asked by BTC who wrote the letter, we as a group took the responsibility because we as a group knew what it said and agreed with it's contents. Regarding the 67% tax increase - that number did not take into consideration the 1% tax cap and we apologize for that error. Without the Tax cap, the number would have been 67%, but with the tax cap Gateway says the increase will be 44%. Check back in the coming days for more interesting information and declarations on the letter and our group's interaction (or non interaction) with BTC.

                  <strong>Brookville, IN</strong>
                  <br>
                  <p><strong>KnowTheFactsBrookville@gmail.com</strong></p>
                  <p>Dear Franklin County Resident,</p>

                  <p>The Brook Hill Preservation LLC. has purchased Brook Hill Golf Club! This is great news and we sincerely wish them all the best. So, why are we still talking about annexation?  Since October of 2018, we have heard of the failing golf course and how a government bailout is the only way to save the golf course. Well, it appears that that is not the case. A group of 15 or so Investors have purchased the course and have been investing their own money to keep the golf course afloat. This appears to be the American way and how business is supposed to work, right!? So, I ask again, why are we still talking about a proposed annexation?</p>
                  
                  <p>On Tuesday, January 14, 2020 at the Brookville Town Council meeting, the Citizens for Voluntary Annexation (AKA the Golf course owners) presented to the council a map of the proposed annexation area.  That’s right, approximately 15 months after annexation was first brought up, we just now have a “true” map.  The map took 15 months to create because previous maps that they proposed did not work out due to non-interest from citizens on the hill. You would think that they would get the point that the majority of people are not for the proposed annexation. However, that did not sink in so, the Brook Hill Pro-Annexation group went door to door and talked to each homeowner to convince them to sign their pro-annexation petition. All the while, telling them that their way of life will not change, their taxes will only go up a little bit, and they won’t HAVE to hook up to sewer if they do not want to. There is no total truth to any of this. This group only wants one thing and that is to save a failing golf course. They do not care about your way of life, but they are willing to say anything to make you think that they do, all to save a golf course.  The same golf course that is now already saved!!</p>

                  <p>If you do not trust our town board to look out for you and those that cannot afford the annexation (i.e. increased taxes and forced sewage hookup), then we need your help. The cost of doubling taxes and expensive forced sewer hookups are going to be too much for some of you and your neighbors to bear.</p>

                  <p>Please see the attached “THE TRUTH ABOUT ANNEXATION” to see just how much your way of life can and WILL change. Here you will read facts, state law statutes, and examples of life changes you might experience if annexation goes through. </p>

                  <p><strong>THE TRUTH ABOUT ANNEXATION</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>It is Not a Done Deal!</strong> ---- The government bailout seekers have submitted a gerrymandered map of the proposed annexation area, one that took 15 months to complete. There are still feasibility studies and public hearings to be done, the time to stop this is now! We need to cut off the head of the snake before it gets started. Now is the time to contact the town clerk and withdraw your petition. See Attached Page.</p>

                  <p><strong>Your Taxes WILL Increase by 67%!</strong> ----The county tax rate for Franklin County is “Total Tax Rate 1.4679%” Your new tax rate when annexed will be “Total Tax Rate 2.447%
                  Example: If your home has an Assessed value of $181,000 and you have a Homestead and Mortgage Exemption, then your taxes will go from $1,254 to $2,090. This is an increase of $836 per year, along with every year that you’re alive or choose to live in your home. That is only if there are no more taxes imposed on the poor, on behalf of the wealthy. Or, what if the 5 people on the town board choose to create a TIF district? Something that they use quite often in town when funds need to be collected to put towards something for the town. What happens when the golf course needs a new club house that hypothetical may not be covered by insurance (TBD) and the 5 board members ask for a bond or take money from fire and police to rebuild that clubhouse?

                </p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Your Way of Life WILL Change!</strong> ---- First off, are you willing to give away all your voting rights to five people who live in town that have never been allowed to ride a quad or shoot a gun on their town property? Are we seriously going to expect them to never ever, as we all live, change our way of life? Once you let them get their foot in the door with the annexation, all they need to do is slowly, meeting by meeting, chip away at your rights. At this point, there is absolutely nothing you will be able to do about it because you do not have a vote. Once you have chosen to give up your right of representation, you have lost all say in the matter. If the annexation goes through and the town owns the hill, that’s exactly what will happen. It’s election season, as I’m sure you can see on TV, every politician is promising something. However, four years from now, I can guarantee you they will follow through with a very small select amount of those promises. Not to mention, when people IN town realize that you have more rights than them (i.e. quads, fires, guns, fireworks, etc.) and they start to complain or want the same things, who do you think will have to change?</p>

                  <div><strong>You WILL Have to Eventually Hook up to Sewer---FACT!!</strong></div>
                  <div>The following is the Indiana State code on forced sewer hookup, word for word. This is the truth and not what some guy, who owns a stake in the golf course, down the road says.</div>

                  <div><strong>Forced Sewer Hook-ups!     IC: 36-9-23-30 Indiana State CODE!</strong></div>
                  <em>IC 36-9-23-30 Municipal power to require connections to sewer and discontinuance of privies, cesspools, septic tanks, and similar structures; conditions; penalties; court order; attorney's fees Sec. 30. (a) Subject to subsection (b) and section 30.1 of this chapter, a municipality thatoperates sewage works under this chapter or under any statute repealed by IC 19-2-5-30 (repealed September 1, 1981) may require:
                    <div>(1) connection to its sewer system of any property producing sewage or similar waste; Indiana Code 2019 and</div>
                    <div>(2) discontinuance of the use of privies, cesspools, septic tanks, and similar structures.</div>
                    <div>(b) A municipality may exercise the powers granted by subsection (a) only if:</div>
                  </em>
                  <br>
                  <em>(1) there is an available sanitary sewer within three hundred (300) feet of the property line of the affected property; and
                    <div>(2) it has given notice by certified mail to the property owner at the address of the property, at least ninety (90) days before the date specified for connection in the notice.</div>
                    <div>(c) A municipality may establish, enforce, and collect reasonable penalties for failure to make a connection under this section.</div>
                    <div>(d) A municipality may apply to the circuit or superior court for the county in which it is located for an order to require a connection under this section. The court shall assess the cost of the action and reasonable attorney's fees of the municipality against the property owner in such an action.</div>
                    <div>[Pre-Local Government Recodification Citation: 19-2-5-22.]</div>
                    <div>As added by Acts 1981, P.L.309, SEC.96. Amended by P.L.3</div>
                  </em>
                  <br>
                  <p>You are 30 days away from the town board of Brookville holding two meetings and forcing you to hook on to their sewer. If the town board runs sewer within 300’ of your property line, you <strong>WILL</strong> be required to hook-up. How else do you think they are going to pay for this endeavor?</p>

                  <div><strong>What would it cost to hookup to a city sewer line?</strong></div>
                  <div><strong>The estimated cost to install a new low-pressure sewer system could range anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 depending on how far your home is away from the new public sewer main.</strong></div>
                  <div><strong>These estimates are from multiple sources.</strong></div>
                  <br>
                  <p>Keep fighting against the proposed annexation!! Spread the word and do your own research. If you find that you have signed a pro-annexation petition, in haste, because you were given false information or were promised things that might not ever happen; fill out the attached document. Bring your signed document to the town clerk, Gina Gillman at 1020 Franklin Avenue, phone number 765-647-3322 and she will take care of it. It is definitely not too late to withdraw your original petition.</p> 

                  <p>If you would like to fight against annexation, ask for a sign or give a donation to help secure an attorney so we can stop this from happening.</p>
